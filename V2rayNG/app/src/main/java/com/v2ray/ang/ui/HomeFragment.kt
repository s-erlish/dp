/**
 * Главная — the screen the app opens on.
 *
 * **THIS SCREEN IS A RESTYLE, NOT A REDESIGN**, and the distinction is the reason this file reads
 * the way it does. A wave rebuilt Главная from `docs/design2026/13-start-screen.md`, dropped the
 * inline server list, the subscription card, the session clock and the connect object's rings and
 * motion, and replaced them with two rows that navigate away. The owner ran that build and rejected
 * it — «как выглядела главная по функционалу такая и должна остаться», «все должно быть вернуто с
 * пилюлей и инфой о подписке под кнопкой». That document now carries an OWNER OVERRULE: its scope is
 * void and only its visual language survives.
 *
 * So everything that screen had is here, drawn on the component layer with tokens and the type ramp:
 *
 *  - the top strip — отдача, время сессии, приём — and the add action, on one line;
 *  - the connect object with its three concentric rings, its negotiating breath and sweep, its
 *    one-shot confirm ring, its press scale and its cold-start assemble;
 *  - the country flag and the server identity under it;
 *  - the subscription card carousel — traffic pill, name, auto-update stamp, the operator's notice,
 *    support and Telegram, refresh, ping, pin, delete;
 *  - the server list, inline, which is the ONLY place in the product a server can be picked.
 *
 * **The fragment renders, it does not decide twice.** [resolveState] reads every input once and
 * returns one [HomeState]; [render] applies it and branches on nothing else.
 *
 * **It owns the CONNECT STATE MACHINE, unchanged in behaviour**: the tap handler, the VPN permission
 * prompt, the connect watchdog, the restart-that-waits-for-a-real-stop, the one-shot auto-fallback
 * with its confirmation re-probe. That state machine is why this fragment is attached at LAUNCH
 * rather than the first time its tab is opened (`MainActivity.syncTabFragments`): a hidden fragment
 * is still RESUMED, so the tunnel is still observed and «Перезапустить» after a core-config change
 * still reaches a running core.
 *
 * The tab's view outlives nothing and outlasts every bind — the shell hides and shows tabs rather
 * than replacing them — so every async callback checks [isBindingInitialized] before touching a view
 * and every posted callback is removed in [onDestroyView].

     * a 5.5s one-shot rather than an indefinite spinner, so standing it down at a prompt costs a
     * decay nobody is reading rather than a signal somebody is.
     *
     * ## …AND THE MOTION WAS NOT THE ONLY THING THAT KEPT RUNNING
     *
     * The same rule — «нельзя тратить на то, чего никто не видит» — applies to the two REPEATING
     * handlers this screen owns, and neither of them obeyed it: they were armed by the running-state
     * observer and stood down only in [onDestroyView], which for a VPN client is almost never. The
     * app spends its life in the background WITH THE TUNNEL UP; that is the normal state, not the
     * exception, and in it the screen went on paying for both loops with nobody looking:
     *
     *  - [uptimeRunnable] woke the main thread once a SECOND, formatted a h:mm:ss string and wrote
     *    it into a TextView that is not on the glass. 3600 wake-ups an hour for an invisible label.
     *  - [latencyRunnable] fired a real probe every 30s: `MSG_MEASURE_DELAY` crosses into the daemon
     *    and `CoreServiceManager.measureV2rayDelay` sends an HTTP request THROUGH THE TUNNEL (twice
     *    when the first URL misses). That is the radio, not the CPU — 120 round trips an hour to
     *    refresh a figure on a screen that is not being shown. Each answer then broadcast back into
     *    this process and drove a full `render()` of the invisible hierarchy.
     *
     * Nothing is lost by standing them down: [onResume] re-arms both, and both come back with a
     * fresh reading in the same frame — the clock re-reads the daemon's own session stamp
     * (`CoreServiceManager.sessionStartedAt`), so it is exact however long the app was away, and the
     * probe posts immediately rather than after an interval, so the «мс» figure the user comes back
     * to is newer than the one he left. The connect watchdog is deliberately NOT stood down: it is a
     * one-shot deadline under an attempt that is still in flight, and an attempt does not stop being
     * in flight because the user switched apps.

     * подключение» — the consent Activity `VpnService.prepare()` hands back (see
     * [startVpnWithPermission]) — and it is DIALOG-THEMED. A dialog-themed activity does not cover
     * the one under it: the shell is paused and STILL ON THE GLASS, in full view behind the prompt.
     * So `onPause` fired while the user was looking straight at Главная, and it cancelled the
     * revolution and stamped the arc back to 0°. What was left on screen was
     * @drawable/ic_connect_arc's fixed 19.7 % of the circumference — one segment of stroke, opaque,
     * perfectly still — under a pill reading «Подключаемся…» and a clock at 00:00:00. That is the
     * photograph, and a busy affordance frozen mid-sweep is the one thing it may never be: it does
     * not say «waiting», it says «hung».
     *
     * IT KEEPS TURNING FOR THE WHOLE WAIT, and that is the honest state as well as the one he asked
     * for. The attempt IS in flight — the user tapped connect and the app is now waiting on HIM
     * rather than on a network — so the object is busy and says so, for as long as he takes. The
     * alternative, holding the object at rest until consent lands, would have the control answer a
     * tap with nothing at all and then start moving on its own later, which is a worse lie.
     *
     * Both answers are already clean and neither needed changing:
     *
     *  - DECLINE lands in [requestVpnPermission]'s else branch, which drops `connectInProgress` and
     *    republishes idle, so the arc winds down through the ordinary exit and the ring fills back.
     *    It now winds down from wherever it actually is instead of from a dead stop at 0°.
     *  - THE WATCHDOG cannot fire at a dialog: [startVpnWithPermission] stands it down BEFORE
     *    launching the prompt and [requestVpnPermission] re-arms it only on RESULT_OK, so the 20s
     *    deadline measures the daemon and never the человек.
     *
     * THE RULE ITSELF IS UNCHANGED — nothing infinite turns while nobody can see it — only the
     * question it is asked. `onStop` is that question: the window is not visible AT ALL. `onPause`
     * only ever meant «something is on top of it». [onResume]'s render() puts the revolution back
     * through showSweep(), which re-arms it without replaying the entrance, and onResume always
     * follows the onStart that answers this.

     * THE RING HANDS ITS BRIGHTNESS TO THE THING THAT MOVES, for exactly as long as something is
     * moving on it.
     *
     * The arc and the ring it travels were the same colour in every state that spins it — while the
     * core negotiates, `connectActiveColor` is `#4C8DFF` and `colorAccentFigure` resolves to the
     * same `#4C8DFF`; while a подписка refreshes on a live tunnel, both are `colorAccentFigure`
     * outright. A bright arc laid over a bright ring of the same hue does not read as motion, and
     * that is the owner's report: «он не ровно по линии вокруг кнопки крутится … надо цвет чутка
     * темнее сделать чтобы был акцент и видно, что идёт анимация».
     *
     * The prototype never had the problem because it never draws both at full: its negotiating ring
     * is `rgba(76,141,255,.30)` and its sweep is the accent. So the difference is restored where the
     * design puts it — on the RING — and the arc keeps the accent it is tinted with. One rule, no
     * new colour, and it works in all three themes because it is an alpha on whatever hue the state
     * already resolved: blue on blue, white on white, and the mono figure on the mono figure.
     *
     * «Темнее» is what an alpha over this product's grounds actually does. In both dark themes 30 %
     * of the hue over `#0B0D10` lands darker than the hue; in the light theme the track goes pale
     * against a white ground, which is the same statement — quieter than the arc — spelled the way
     * a light theme spells it.
     *
     * Restored as the arc stops, so a connected object is the full-strength accent ring §4 asks for
     * and an idle one is its muted static ring.
     *
     * ## AND IT IS A MOVEMENT
     *
     *     «получается пролаг … потом слишком резко конец анимации и возврат полной заливки вокруг
     *      кольца … надо доработать чтобы это было плавно, а не так резко»
     *
     * This used to be a property write: the boolean flipped and `applyRingColor` repainted the
     * stroke in that frame. So the arc left over 165ms while the ring under it came back in one —
     * two events where the eye expects one, and the harder one landed first. [ringTrackAlpha] is
     * what fixed that: the intent flips in a frame, the VALUE travels.
     *
     * [over] is the length of the movement the arc is making at this instant, handed in by
     * [paintConnect] from [showSweep] / [hideSweep]. Zero means «no movement to join» — a repaint
     * that finds the arc already where it belongs — and then this lands instantly, which is also the
     * reduced-motion answer. **It is a gate on both directions and the CLOCK on only one.**
     *
     * ## …AND THE TWO DIRECTIONS ARE NOT THE SAME MOVEMENT
     *
     *     «полное кольцо оно плавно исчезает и начинается анимация обновления, а после конца
     *      обновления подписки кольцо резко обратно возвращается, надо также чтобы оно плавно
     *      возвращалось вокруг кнопки, я про заливку эту»
     *
     * He is precise, and the report is asymmetric: the way IN is right, the way BACK is not. Both
     * ran on `over` and on `ease_standard`, so the number was never the difference — the CATEGORY
     * was.
     *
     * GOING DOWN, THE RING IS HANDING OVER. The arc is arriving on top of it and the eye is on the
     * arc; the ring's fade is the background half of one gesture, so it belongs on the arc's clock
     * (`motion_windup`, 200) and finishes with it. Untouched.
     *
     * COMING BACK, THE RING IS THE ONLY THING LEFT ON SCREEN. The arc is dissolving and there is
     * nothing else to look at, so this is not the tail of an exit — it is an ELEMENT ARRIVING ON A
     * SCREEN THAT IS ALREADY THERE, which motion.xml §8 names and prices: `motion_appear` (460) on
     * `ease_out_quint`. Joined to the exit it inherited two things it should never have had:
     *
     *  - `ease_standard` is cubic-bezier(.2, 0, 0, 1) — HALF the travel in the first fifth of the
     *    window. Over an exit that is what you want, because an exit should be gone. Over the one
     *    object the eye is now locked to it is a step with a tail, which is «резко» exactly.
     *  - [hideSweep] hands over [windDownSweep]'s window, and that window is 165–440ms depending on
     *    WHERE THE ARC HAPPENED TO BE STANDING when the подписка landed. The same gesture came out a
     *    different length on every refresh, and at the floor it was back to full in under 90ms.
     *
     * The two still START in the same frame, which is what makes them one gesture; they simply do
     * not have to END together. The arc leaves, the track it was riding fills back in behind it.

            // come back to the first, then collapse the list. The card slides across and off screen.
            //
            // The reason it survived the previous fix is that ViewPager2 owns this animator and
            // hands it back and forth: setPageTransformer(non-null) saves the animator and nulls it,
            // setPageTransformer(null) RESTORES it. rebuildHomeMeta used to swap the transformer in
            // and out with the подписка count, so dropping from two подписки to one handed the
            // animator back and re-armed the bug. Hence both lines below: strip the animator here,
            // once, and never let the transformer be set to null again (see setPageTransformer
            // below, which is now unconditional).

            // подписки … почему-то можно растягивать и тянуть влево или вправо, надо убрать это».
            // From Android 12 a RecyclerView answers a drag past its own edge with the stretch
            // over-scroll — the whole page is pulled sideways and springs back. On a carousel of
            // ONE there is nowhere to go, so every horizontal drag on the card is over-scroll and
            // the card is rubber. It is set on the inner RecyclerView and not on the pager,
            // because ViewPager2 forwards nothing of the sort — `android:overScrollMode` on the
            // pager itself reaches a container that does not scroll.
            //
            // ALWAYS, not just at one подписка: a card that stretches at the ends of a real
            // carousel is the same defect with a smaller repro. Swiping BETWEEN подписки is
            // untouched — that is the pager's own scroll, not over-scroll.
            //
            // …AND THE PAGE STOPS BEING CUT OFF AT THE GUTTER, which is the third report on this

     * `importConfigViaSub()` — it walks the подписки that are ALREADY on the device and re-fetches
     * each one. A minute-old account has none, so that call finds nothing, returns in the half

     * it was written: «signing in fires refreshSubscriptions() before the account's подписка has
     * been written». The refresh is not the work; THIS is the work, and it reported to nobody.

     * [MainHost.reportSubscriptionImport] and not the shell's `showLoading`, because those two
     * things are not the same: `showLoading` also raises the in-flight bar and spins the connect
     * arc, and this import runs at EVERY cold start with a stored session, where announcing it
     * would be the app reporting an errand nobody started.
     *
     * EVERY EXIT LOWERS IT. The bracket is a `finally`, so a failure, a cancelled scope (the

     *
     *  - `accountResolved` starts false whenever the user is signed in, so the first [render] takes
     *    [paintHeader]'s loading branch — the text column is hidden and a skeleton is armed at
     *    300ms. Those skeleton bars are `colorSurfaceContainerHighest` on `bg_skeleton_bar`, i.e.
     *    two dark blocks where the name and «Управление аккаунтом» belong;
     *  - `account_tile` is VISIBLE in the layout by default and only [bindAccountRow] hides it, so
     *    the 40dp slot showed @drawable/bg_tile_neutral — a dark tile — until the profile arrived
     *    and swapped in the avatar;
     *  - and the profile only arrives on the collector in [observeAccount], which is inside a
     *    `repeatOnLifecycle(STARTED)` and therefore cannot run until after `onViewCreated` has
     *    returned. So the loading dress is guaranteed to be the one that reaches the screen first.
     *
     * `AccountSession.state` is a `StateFlow` seeded synchronously from `AuthTokenStore` — the
     * profile is in memory, off MMKV, with no I/O at all. Reading its CURRENT VALUE here, before
     * the first render, is the whole fix: the row is painted with the real identity in the frame it
     * is first drawn, and neither the tile nor the skeleton is ever shown.
     *
     * The skeleton machinery is untouched and still covers the case it was written for — a session

     * THE SONAR, AND IT MOVES ON ITS OWN — the two confirm rings, thrown clear of the object once

     *
     * THE RINGS USED TO BE MOVED BY THE BOX THEY FLY OUT OF, and that is the third face of the
     * fault the owner keeps reporting as «улетают за невидимый квадрат». A legacy view animation
     * (`View.startAnimation`, @anim/connect_confirm) does not belong to the view it plays on: the
     * PARENT resolves it every frame — `ViewGroup.getChildTransformation()` — and hands the result
     * to the child inside its own draw pass, so the ring's geometry is computed by, and travels
     * through, the 214dp frame. The two causes already known for this class of defect are the
     * same shape: a container that clips its children, and a hardware layer handed to the
     * container instead of to what moves inside it. This is the same mistake spelled a third way,
     * and it is the one Главная had left — the clip is off on connect_frame, home_content and
     * home_tab_root (fragment_home.xml), and no layer was ever put on the frame.
     *
     * So the rings are property animators now: SCALE_X/SCALE_Y/ALPHA on the ring's OWN RenderNode,
     * exactly the construction [com.v2ray.ang.ui.component.FlowOverlay.playFinale] uses for the
     * прогрузка sonar. One [AnimatorSet] with a start delay for the echo, never a chain of
     * `postDelayed`.
     *
     * The hardware layer goes on the two rings — the things that move — and comes back off when
     * the set ends OR is cancelled, which is why the listener answers both. Never on
     * @id/connect_frame: a layer is a buffer the size of the view it is given to, and one on the
     * frame would re-impose the very 214dp square the layout has stopped drawing.
     *
     * EVERY NUMBER IS THE ONE THE DESIGN STATES, and they are the numbers @anim/connect_confirm
     * carried:
     *
     *     lead  scale 1 -> 1.6, alpha 1.0 -> 0, @integer/motion_emphasis (600) on ease_out_quint,
     *           which IS the prototype's own `sonar 600ms cubic-bezier(.22,1,.36,1)` at
     *           `inset:22px`, i.e. on the 170dp active ring thrown out to 272dp;
     *     echo  scale 1 -> 1.5, alpha 0.5 -> 0, same 600 on the same curve, one
     *           @integer/motion_press_in (70) behind — the desktop's Sonar.pulsing-echo.
     *
     * The ring is parked at the END of its travel and hidden there, rather than being snapped back
     * to 1.0 at full opacity for the frame between the last animation frame and the callback: the
     * prototype's `animation-fill-mode: both` says the same thing, and the old `fillAfter="false"`
     * was one frame of an opaque 170dp accent ring sitting on the object's own inner ring.
