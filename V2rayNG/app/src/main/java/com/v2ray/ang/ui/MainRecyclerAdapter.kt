    /**
     * THE DRAG CONTRACT IS OFF THIS FILE, and every piece of it was inert.
     *
     * This adapter used to implement `ItemTouchHelperAdapter` and its holder
     * `ItemTouchHelperViewHolder`, which between them are five methods: `onItemMove` (returned
     * `false`), `onItemMoveCompleted` and `onItemDismiss` (empty), and the holder's
     * `onItemSelected` / `onItemClear` — the grey wash a dragged row wore, painted as a raw
     * `Color.LTGRAY` over a row whose whole look is `@drawable/bg_server_row`.
     *
     * All five are called by `SimpleItemTouchHelperCallback`, and NO `ItemTouchHelper` is attached
     * to Главная's list (see `HomeFragment.setupServerList`) — reordering there belongs to the
     * провайдер, not the finger. The three screens that DO drag keep the interfaces and their own
     * adapters; this one was carrying a contract nobody could invoke.
