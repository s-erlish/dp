     *
     *   WHAT THE IDLE SERVICE COSTS. Nothing that draws power: no core loop, no timers, no
     *   wakelocks, no radio — `startSpeedNotification` refuses to run without a live core, and so
     *   does the delay probe, so a screen-on while paused re-starts neither. What it holds is the
     *   `:RunSoLibV2RayDaemon` process resident and one foreground-service slot. That buys the one
     *   property this feature is built on: an FGS notification is exempt from the Android 14 change
     *   that made ongoing notifications dismissible, so the way back cannot be swiped away. A row
     *   left behind by a service that had stopped would have no such protection.
     *
     *   The exposure to know about: the declared type is `specialUse`, which no shipped platform
     *   puts a timeout on, but the platform has been adding per-type timeouts release by release
     *   (`dataSync`, `mediaProcessing` on 15). If one ever lands on `specialUse`, this service
     *   becomes a candidate for it, and the answer is `Service.onTimeout` ending the pause the way
     *   «Остановить» does — not a change to the mechanic.
     *
     *   Two things deliberately do NOT happen under it: the notification is not cancelled, and
     *   the command receiver stays registered — «Остановить» on the paused row is the user's way
     *   out of the pause and it travels on that receiver.
