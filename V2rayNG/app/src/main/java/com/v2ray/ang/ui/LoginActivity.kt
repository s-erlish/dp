/**
 * Sign-in, rebuilt to 14-auth.md.
 *
 * The screen this replaces showed every method at once — two cards, two filled accent buttons of
 * equal weight, a 2FA block hidden inside the second card, and a centred error line at the bottom of
 * a scroll — so nothing on it was primary and two of its blocks could contradict each other. This
 * one has a hierarchy and a machine:
 *
 * ```
 * A · the gate            «Войти через Telegram»  ← contour pill, Telegram glyph #2AABEE
 *     │                   «Войти по почте»          the same pill, envelope glyph
 *     └ awaiting          the universal 56dp ledger row, not a centred hero spinner
 *
 * B · «Вход по почте»     сегмент «Вход | Регистрация» → email + password → «Войти»
 *     ├ регистрация      the same fields plus «Повторите пароль» → «Создать аккаунт»
 *     ├ подтверждение    the letter carries a LINK: a wait, a poll, and no field
 *     ├ 2FA              replaces the password slot; six cells over one real field
 *     └ восстановление   «Восстановить пароль» → тот же адрес, письмо, «отправлено»
 * ```
 *
 * **The redesign pass (2026-08-17).** The owner opened this screen and found the version that
 * predates the handoff: a back chevron pointing right, a filled white «Войти через Telegram» and a
 * text «Войти по почте». All three are gone. The back glyph was never this screen's own — every
 * icon button in the app wears `@anim/press_icon`, whose resting item animates `scaleX` to 1.0 and
 * so undid the `scaleX="-1"` mirror both headers used; it is a real `ic_chevron_left` now. There
 * are no filled surfaces left here: every action is the start screen's 52dp contour pill, so the
 * two sign-in surfaces a user can meet look like one product. And «Войти по почте» is off the
 * screen — the owner's ruling folds e-mail, OTP, 2FA and Google into one «Войти через сайт», which
 * opens this very form. Nothing was deleted to do it. (That name lasted until registration came
 * home and the door was renamed «Войти по почте» — see below.)
 *
 * **Every method that worked before still works**, through the same entry points: a plain launch
 * lands on A, [EXTRA_MODE] = [MODE_SITE] lands straight on B, [MODE_TELEGRAM] lands on A (where
 * Telegram is already the primary), [MODE_TELEGRAM_START] lands on A with the attempt already
 * running, and [EXTRA_LINK] runs the same Telegram flow with the JWT of the account that is already
 * signed in, so the backend links instead of logging a second one in.
 *
 * **Why the fourth mode exists, and why nothing calls it today (2026-08-17).** The Аккаунт tab's
 * signed-out block was rebuilt to look exactly like this gate — same heading, same two contour
 * pills, same order — and its «Войти через Telegram» opened [MODE_TELEGRAM], which is this gate. So
 * the tap answered the question and the answer was the question again: «нажимаешь вход через
 * телеграм, открывается снова окно где предлагается войти через телеграм». [MODE_TELEGRAM_START]
 * was the answer to that: mint the token on entry and land on the awaiting stack, so the method is
 * carried out rather than offered twice.
 *
 * It removed the duplicated CHOICE and left the duplicated SCREEN, which is what the owner reported
 * next: «меня кидает на новое окно где опять кнопки открыть телеграм и вход через сайт, этого быть
 * не должно, ВСЁ ДОЛЖНО ПРОИСХОДИТЬ НА ВКЛАДКЕ АККАУНТ». A tap on a tab that already shows the
 * offer must not push an Activity at all — so the tab runs the flow in place now
 * (`AccountFragment.startTelegramSignIn` -> `TelegramFlow`), exactly as Главная's start screen
 * always has, and this mode has no caller left.
 *
 * **It is kept, and so is the gate.** Refinement is not removal: the entry point moved, the
 * capability did not. A caller that has NOT named the method still wants [MODE_TELEGRAM] — the gate
 * is the screen where the choice is made, «Привязать Telegram» arrives on it, and a caller that HAS
 * named the method but cannot host an overlay still wants [MODE_TELEGRAM_START]. Both surfaces,
 * both stacks and every path through them are untouched and tested by the site route, which shares
 * all of it.
 *
 * **What is deliberately gone**: the `Toast` on a failure the user can act on, and the debug
 * `AlertDialog` that put the raw HTTP body on screen (14-auth.md 13.3, D-14.F). The cause goes to
 * the log; the customer gets a sentence that names the fix.
 *
 * **REGISTRATION CAME HOME (2026-09-02).** «а регистрации внутри приложения не увидел, там
 * регистрация через сайт идёт, а не через приложение» — and the owner was reading the screen
 * correctly: «Создать аккаунт» was a row that opened `departament.site/register` in a browser,
 * because the client carried no register call. It carries one now
 * ([com.v2ray.ang.auth.AuthManager.beginRegister]), so the row is gone and the errand is a SEGMENT
 * at the top of the form — «Вход | Регистрация» — over the same fields, with «Повторите пароль»
 * appearing for the second of them. The door on the way in was renamed with it: «Войти через
 * сайт» became «Войти по почте», because nothing behind it goes to a site any more.
 *
 * **The letter carries a LINK, not a code** (checked by the owner on the live panel). That single
 * fact decides the whole confirmation step: there is nothing to type, so no field is drawn, and the
 * app watches for the link being opened instead of asking about it — the poll re-tries the LOGIN
 * with the credentials just registered, which answers 401 until the address is proved and 200 the
 * moment it is. The user's part is to open the letter; ours is to notice.
 *
 * **AND THE THIRD ERRAND ON THIS FORM (2026-09-02): ПРИВЯЗКА ПОЧТЫ.** The «Почта» row under
 * «Способы входа» named an address when the account had one and did nothing at all when it did
 * not — it opened [MODE_SITE], and the first thing `onCreate` does with a signed-in visitor is
 * `finish()`. It is tapped in exactly one situation: somebody signed in through Telegram wants an
 * address on the account. [MODE_LINK_EMAIL] is that errand.
 *
 * It is the same form with two thirds of it taken away — no segment, no password, no «Восстановить
 * пароль» — because none of that belongs to it: the account exists, the request is signed by its
 * token, and the panel is being asked for a letter rather than for a credential. What is left is
 * one field, one sentence saying what will happen to the account (nothing: it stays the same one),
 * and «Отправить ссылку».
 *
 * **The wait afterwards is the registration's wait**, deliberately and to the pixel — same ledger
 * row, same ring, same success beat, same «Отправить снова» over a tertiary way out. Only the
 * question being asked underneath differs: registration re-tries the LOGIN until the link is
 * opened, this one re-reads the PROFILE until it carries an address
 * ([com.v2ray.ang.auth.AuthManager.beginLinkEmail]).
 *
 * **AND THE ERRAND THE LINKING ONE WAS MISSING (2026-09-02): ПАРОЛЬ.** Checked against the panel's
 * own source: `verify-link-email` writes `email` and nothing else, and `PendingEmailLink` has no
 * password column at all. So an attached address was an IDENTIFIER and not a way in — the very
 * thing the user attached it for. [MODE_LINK_EMAIL] now ends on «Придумайте пароль», over the same
 * two password fields registration uses, and only then is the copy entitled to say the address can
 * be signed in with. **Six characters**, because `set-password` has its own schema and its floor is
 * lower than registration's eight; writing 8 here would refuse a password the panel would take.
 *
 * The step is OFFERED, never forced: the address is already on the account by then and the caller's
 * result is already OK, so «Пропустить» and system Back both simply close. It is also skipped
 * outright when the panel would refuse it — `UserProfileDto.canSetPassword` mirrors that gate — so
 * an account that already has a password never sees a step whose only possible answer is a refusal.
 *
 * **And skipping it does not lose it.** [MODE_SET_PASSWORD] is the same step reached on its own,
 * from a «Почта» row that says «Нужен пароль для входа» whenever the account has an address and no
 * password. Without that route the offer was one-shot and a declined one left an address that
 * quietly could not be signed in with — the exact defect the step was added to close, one screen
 * further on.
 *
 * **[MODE_CHANGE_EMAIL]** is the same three beats for an address that already exists: form, letter,
 * wait. Two things differ, both because the account has something to lose. The panel guards it with
 * the CURRENT password for any account that has one, and answers `PASSWORD_REQUIRED` /
 * `INVALID_PASSWORD` — codes, not statuses, and both belong on the password FIELD (a bare 401 here
 * would otherwise read as «сессия истекла» to somebody who merely mistyped). And the wait asks a
 * sharper question: not «есть ли адрес», which is already true and would end the wait on its first
 * round, but «стал ли он новым».
 *
 * **AND THE LAST ERRAND THAT STILL LEFT THE APP (2026-09-02): ВОССТАНОВЛЕНИЕ ПАРОЛЯ.** «Восстановить
 * пароль» opened `departament.site/forgot-password` in a browser, for precisely the reason
 * «Создать аккаунт» once did — the client carried no call. It carries one now
 * ([com.v2ray.ang.auth.AuthManager.requestPasswordReset]), and the row opens a step of this same
 * form: [FormMode.RESET], one field, «Отправить ссылку». The field is the one the user has already
 * typed their address into, which is the whole reason the errand is a step here and not a screen
 * somewhere else.
 *
 * **AND ITS «ОТПРАВЛЕНО» DOES NOT WAIT, because there is nothing to wait for.** The other two
 * letters change something this app can ask about — a registration proves an address, a link
 * writes one onto the profile — so a poll has a question and the ring is that question being
 * asked. A new password changes neither, and the app never sees the token in the letter
 * (`password-reset/consume` is the site's call, not ours). So the same block reports it with the
 * ring swapped for a static tile: «Письмо отправлено», «Отправить снова», «Назад».
 *
 * **The copy over it is conditional and that is the panel's rule, not caution.** The endpoint
 * answers a known address and an unknown one identically so it cannot be used to enumerate
 * customers; «мы отправили письмо на <адрес>» would give away the answer it withholds.
 *
 * **What is deliberately absent rather than disabled**: magic link, the browser hand-off and
 * Google. `DepartamentApiClient` carries no call for any of them, so a control here would
 * advertise a feature instead of offering one.
