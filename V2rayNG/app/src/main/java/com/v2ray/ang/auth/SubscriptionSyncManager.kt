/**

 *
 * This is the only place that touches the existing config code, and it reuses rather than
 * duplicates it:
 *  - [MmkvManager.encodeSubscription] / [MmkvManager.decodeSubscription] persist each item
 *  - [AngConfigManager.updateConfigViaSub] fetches + parses the servers (no new parsing)
 *  - [SubscriptionUpdater.syncOne] / [SubscriptionUpdater.cancelOne] handle periodic refresh
 *
 * The uuid->guid mapping is owned by [AuthTokenStore]; MmkvManager does not return the guid it
 * generates, so we generate a stable one ourselves on first import and remember it.
