/**
 * ============================================================================
 * WHO IS ALLOWED TO INTERRUPT THE USER.
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * The owner, on the whole layer rather than on one message:
 *
 *     «все вот такие уведомления нужно в целом убрать, это же старые от в2рей уведомления,
 *      и по qr коду когда добавляешь там внизу уведомление красное и тд, их убрать надо совсем»
 *
 * WHAT HE IS LOOKING AT. Upstream v2rayNG answers almost every action with a `Toasty` popup — a
 * green tick, a red cross, a system-chrome capsule floating over the app — and the sentence inside
 * it is written for the person who wrote the parser: «Обновлено серверов: 13 (успешно: 1, ошибки:
 * 0, пропущено: 1)», «Ошибка», a raw `e.message`, a `[VLESS] Finland(***12:443)` node summary.
 * Those popups are the single loudest tell that this app is a rebranded fork, and there were
 * FIFTY-ODD of them reachable from screens departament ships.
 *
 * THE DESKTOP SOLVED THIS SHAPE FIRST and its note is the one worth copying
 * (`v2rayN.Desktop/Common/NoticePolicy.cs`): filter the CHANNEL, not the surface. There, the
 * message still reaches the log and the connect screen still reads the failure reason; only the
 * popup is refused. Same here — every call site keeps compiling, every message still reaches
 * `LogUtil`, and this object decides what a human ever sees.
 *
 * THE FOUR RULES, and they are the whole policy:
 *
 *  1. **Success is silent.** The timestamp moved, the list repainted, the editor closed, the
 *     card redrew — that IS the confirmation, and it is a better one than a word that covers the
 *     thing it is confirming. `toastSuccess` reaches no surface at all, in any screen.
 *
 *  2. **A failure the user must act on gets ONE short sentence**, in the product's voice, on the
 *     ONE bottom feedback surface, above the navigation. An invalid QR, an unimportable
 *     clipboard, a подписка that returned nothing, a refresh that could not reach the operator:
 *     silence there would leave a tap with no answer, which is the opposite defect.
 *
 *  3. **Nothing reaches a human unless it is on [ALLOWED].** This is an allow-list and not a
 *     block-list on purpose: the next upstream merge will add `toast(R.string.something)` call
 *     sites, and every one of them is silent here until a person puts the id in this table and
 *     reads the sentence it prints. That is the property the owner asked for — that the layer
 *     cannot come back by itself.
 *
 *  4. **A message with no string id is machine text**, and machine text is never shown. Counters
 *     («…успешно: 1, ошибки: 0…»), node summaries, exception messages and file paths all arrive
 *     through the `CharSequence` door because they are all built by concatenation. Anything the
 *     product genuinely means to say has a resource id and can be listed above. [isMachineText]
 *     is a second net under the same door for the cases that get a formatted id anyway.
 *
 * The IN-FLIGHT SIGNAL is not on this channel and is not filtered by it. «Обновляем данные…» is a
 * state, not a notification — the owner's own G2 rule is that an action in flight must show
 * itself — so it has its own entry point, [progress], on the same bottom surface where he asked
 * for it («это уведомление нужно снизу над панелью навигации»).

    /**
     * ============================================================================
     * RULE 5, AND IT IS ABOUT THE MOMENT RATHER THAN THE MESSAGE.
     * ============================================================================
     *
     * Nothing speaks while a full-screen flow is on the screen.
     *
     *     «когда залогинился через телеграм, анимация прошла и начала появляться главная, внизу
     *      уведомление появилось "нет подписок для обновления", потом подгрузилось, в общем
     *      как-то багнуло»
     *
     * The sentence he saw is a TRUE one and it is on [ALLOWED] on purpose: signing in fires
     * `refreshSubscriptions()` before the account's подписка has been written, so the refresh
     * really does find nothing to refresh, and «Обновить» with no подписки stored really does need
     * an answer — on the screen where a person pressed «Обновить». It has no business on top of a
     * sign-in the user is still in the middle of: the прогрузка overlay owns the whole window and
     * states its own progress in four steps, and a bar sliding out from under it reports on an
     * errand nobody started and about a condition that resolves itself two seconds later.
     *
     * WHY HERE AND NOT AT THE CALL SITE. The same three lines would otherwise have to be added to
     * `MainActivity.importConfigViaSub`, and then to the next thing the flow triggers, and the one
     * after that — the defect would be fixed for one sentence rather than for the moment. This is
     * the layer that decides who may interrupt the user, and «not now» is the same kind of answer
     * as «not ever». Rule 3's property holds either way: the allow-list is still the only door,
     * this only closes it for a while.
     *
     * A BOOLEAN AND NOT A COUNTER, because a counter that leaks silences the app for the rest of
     * the session. It is raised and lowered by the ONE contract that already brackets every
     * full-screen flow — [com.v2ray.ang.ui.component.HomeHandoff] and `MainActivity`'s
     * `holdHomeEntrance` / `revealHome` — and every path out of a flow, including the cancelled and
     * the failed one, goes through the release half (`GateView.releaseHome`). Setting the same
     * value twice costs nothing, so the two entry points cannot get out of step.
