/**
 * The auth state machine (14-auth.md §4), owned here so every UI decision on the sign-in surfaces
 * is a pure function of [state] + [error] + the form buffers.
 *
 * The screen this replaces had no machine at all: the Telegram awaiting block and the 2FA block
 * were independent `visibility` toggles on one scroll and could be on screen at the same time,
 * saying two contradictory things. Here exactly one [AuthUiState] is live, starting any method
 * cancels the one before it ([loginJob]), and there is no state a surface cannot draw.
 *
 * Three invariants from 4.3 are enforced in this file rather than asked of the caller:
 *
 * 1. **At most one method is in flight.** Every entry point cancels [loginJob] first, including the
 *    Telegram poll.
 * 2. **The deep link opens once per token.** [openedDeepLink] lives in [SavedStateHandle], so a
 *    rotation re-renders the awaiting stack without re-launching Telegram.
 * 3. **A failure is rendered, never re-raised.** [error] is a separate, idempotent value rather than
 *    a terminal state: re-collecting it after a rotation redraws the same line (which is correct —
 *    the message must survive turning the phone) while nothing re-fires. It is cleared by starting
 *    a new attempt, by fixing the field it belongs to, or by [consumeError].
 *
 * The `ApiError -> string` mapping (13.1) lives here too, so no Activity has to know what a 410 is,
 * and so both surfaces phrase the same failure identically.
