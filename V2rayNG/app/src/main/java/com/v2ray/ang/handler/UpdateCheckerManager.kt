 * application. It used to poll `2dust/v2rayNG` and hand back whatever APK that project had
 * published (M-07); the feed is [AppConfig.APP_API_URL] now, and provenance is re-checked at every
 * step that could still go wrong — the asset name, the parsed package name, and the version code —
 * so a mistyped constant or a redirected host cannot turn into an install.
 *
 * Every failure is a [UpdateFailure], not an exception message: the screen has to be able to say
 * *why* in the product's voice and put the retry next to the reason (G2), and a raw `e.message` is
