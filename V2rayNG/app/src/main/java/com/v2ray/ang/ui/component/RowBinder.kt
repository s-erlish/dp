/**
 * The universal row - `res/layout/view_row.xml` bound in one call (22-components.md 8,
 * 32-master-plan-android.md 8.1).
 *
 * This is the single most repeated object in the product, and the reason this package exists: the
 * same structure is hand-inlined over a hundred times in the shipped app and the copies have
 * drifted 2 to 4dp apart. Geometry belongs to the layout and to
 * `@style/Widget.Departament.Row`:
 *
 * ```
 * [ 16 gutter ][ 40 tile r12, 22 glyph ][ 12 ][ text column, weight 1 ][ 12 ][ ONE trailing ][ 16 ]
 * ```
 *
 * This binder owns the row's CONTENT and its STATE, and it enforces the three things geometry
 * cannot:
 *
 * 1. **Exactly one trailing element.** [Trailing] is a closed set and the binder hides every
 *    affordance it was not asked for, on every bind. Two trailing elements are not "discouraged"
 *    here, they are unreachable. The same reset is what makes recycling safe: a row that was a
 *    switch last frame cannot keep its switch when it is rebound as a chevron.
 * 2. **The row's job is never split in two.** When the trailing element is itself the action
 *    ([Trailing.IconAction], [Trailing.ActionButton]) the row is not a target, per 22-components
 *    8.4 - two targets doing different things is the `layout_subscription_meta_bar` mistake.
 *    Passing `onClick` alongside one of those throws rather than shipping the defect.
 * 3. **State is announced, not only drawn.** A toggle row reports itself to TalkBack as checkable
 *    and checked, a selected row as selected (00-rules.md 14.9).
 *
 * The rest follows the spec: the whole row is the touch target, it GROWS with a two-line subtitle
 * rather than clipping, press feedback is the background step in `@drawable/bg_row` and never a
 * scale (R5), text is styled by applying a ramp role and never by an inline size or face, and every
 * icon-only control carries a name.
