/**
 * Why the update check or the download stopped — as a value the screen can read, not as a message.
 *
 * The updater used to answer every dead end with one sentence, «Проверьте сеть и повторите», and
 * before that with the raw `e.message` of whatever threw. Both are the same defect: the user is
 * told to retry a thing that will fail again for a reason nobody named. G2 says an action that
 * fails says why and offers the retry in the same place, so the *why* has to survive the trip from
 * `UpdateCheckerManager` to `CheckUpdateActivity` — which means it cannot be an exception message.
 *
 * The exception carries no text on purpose. `CheckUpdateActivity.reasonFor` maps a [Reason] to a
 * string resource; nothing built by concatenation ever reaches a person.
